                <p id="about" > Hello! I'm a fourth year student at California Polytechnic State University studying Software Engineering.
                <br> I grew up in Folsom, CA.
                </p>

                    <h3> Melatonin Dreams</h3>
                    <p id="meldreams">
                    In open fields<br>
                    I fall asleep in seconds,<br>
                    above a steep desert canyon,<br>
                    watching the mountain goats eat the weeds.<br><br> 

                    There’s a butterscotch colored mill,<br>
                    with oak sap squeezing through its panels,<br>
                    the light scent of sawmill dust.<br><br>

                    A pinecone bonfire and grilled tilapia:<br>
                    taking a compass and a toy machete into the woods,<br>
                    searching for the flattest skipping stone.<br><br>

                    A window that lets in the smell of wet concrete,<br>  
                    the colorless Monterey sky through rainy lenses,<br>
                    lonely seagulls blaring love songs.<br><br>

                    Italian castles fifty miles apart,<br>
                    vineyards covering the space,<br>
                    the background to clichés. <br>
                    </p>
            </div>
